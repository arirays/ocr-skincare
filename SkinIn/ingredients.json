    "name": "Alcohol Denat",
    "facts": "Type of ingredient: Alcohol.\n\nMain benefits: Alcohol denat is largely used in skincare and cosmetics more for its formulation benefits, rather than having any actual positive effects on the skin. It helps products spread easily and absorb quickly and acts as a preservative, says Cheung. Because it removes oils from the skin, it can also help other ingredients penetrate better, adds Petrillo (though this is precisely what makes it so drying). This is also why it may occasionally be used to de-grease skin and as prep before a chemical peel, Cheung points out.\n\nWho should use it: According to the experts we spoke with, it's generally an ingredient to avoid, though it's a major no-no for those with dry or sensitive skin.\n\nHow often can you use it: It's best not to use it all, but if it's in one of your favorite products, use it sparingly, not more that once every two weeks, warns Johnson.\n\nWorks well with: Many ingredients, hence why it's so commonly used.\n\nDon't use with: Again, you want to be cautious of alcohol denat to begin with, but because it does increase the penetration of other ingredients, be especially wary of products where it's combined with other potential irritants, such as fragrance, notes Gonzalez."

    "facts": "Type of ingredient: Acid/chemical exfoliant.\n\nMain benefits: Exfoliates the top layers of skin to minimize dullness and even out texture; some AHAs can also stimulate collagen production, while others have antioxidant and hydrating properties.\n\nWho should use it: Given their wide range of effects, most people can benefit from using AHAs, says Nazarian, so long as you find the right alpha-hydroxy acid and concentration of it for your skin type.\n\nHow often can you use it: This differs greatly based on the particular acid, product, and your skin. Follow product directions, but always start slow, using any AHA only once or twice per week and gradually increasing frequency as your skin can tolerate it, suggests Nussbaum.\n\nWorks well with: Peptides can slow the penetration of AHAs, making them less irritating, says Nussbaum. You can also pair them with hydrating ingredients.\n\nDon't use with: Avoid using retinoids at the same time of day as AHAs, and be cautious when using both BHAs (beta hydroxy acids, such as salicylic acid) and AHAs in order to minimize irritation."

It's also a good pick for anyone with dry skin as it helps allocate moisture to the area of application.\n\nHow often can you use it: It can be used daily.\n\nWorks well with: One study suggests that it works well in conjunction with another peptide, tripeptide-10-citrulline, which increases the permeability for Argireline to penetrate to a depth where it can target muscles that cause wrinkles.

All antioxidants also work well with sunscreen, offering an added layer of protection.\n\nDon't use with: Benzoyl peroxide might oxidize vitamin C and should therefore be avoided.

If it is included in a product's formulation, follow the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nWorks well with: Russak recommends combining avocado oil with retinol. \"The most absorption of the retinol happens with a fat-soluble content,\" Russak explains. \"Combining it with an oil will increase absorption and decrease the irritation from it.\" Although avocado oil has moisturizing properties, Hayag says it also would be beneficial for maximal moisture to use in combination with a humectant like hyaluronic acid to draw water into the skin.\n\nDon't use with: There are no ingredients that contraindicate with avocado oil, but Russak suggests refraining from using the oil with other oils, such as vitamin K. \"You're just creating too much of the lipids on the surface of the skin, and lipids start competing in terms of how they penetrate the skin, so it will decrease the efficacy of whatever you're trying to do,\" Russak explains."

Cephalexin also might be a good option for women planning to become pregnant or currently pregnant but experiencing moderate-to-severe acne flares and can't use traditional acne treatments.\n\nHow often can you use it: Cephalexin should be taken as advised by your doctor, but Baxt says for acne, it would likely be prescribed twice daily for two to four weeks. Black adds, \"long-term antibiotic use can be avoided by using other, often more effective treatment modalities.\".\n\nWorks well with: Since very few oral medications are ideal as a monotherapy, Dhingra stresses the importance of continuing a topical regimen prescribed by your dermatologist.\n\nDon't use with: Ali says when taking cephalexin, alcohol should be avoided; otherwise, there are no restrictions."

When applied to the skin, collagen can be used be morning or night or both as it's not sun-sensitizing.\n\nWorks well with: If your ultimate goal of using collagen skincare is to stimulate collagen production, Hayag recommends adding to your routine a retinoid or retinol (which she calls the gold standard for boosting collagen) or peptides and growth factors as a less irritating option that can help by acting as \"messengers\" to signal cells to create collagen. Hayag also recommends vitamin C (another collagen producer) and sunscreen with UVA protection to prevent your collagen from breaking down further.\n\nDon't use with: In general, collagen is safe to use with most ingredients and topical products. \"When you apply hydrolyzed collagen, it gets right into the skin and penetrates rapidly,\" Graf explains, and for that reason, she says it shouldn't interfere with any other product or ingredient."

It is advised to patch-test gold products to see if your skin can tolerate it or not.\n\nHow often can you use it: Gold can be found in a variety of skincare products that each call for a different set of instructions. Because of this, you should follow the brand's directions as best practice. While the product is an antioxidant that is meant to soothe irritated skin, too much of a good thing can have some less-than-desired effects. \"Using too much can cause other problems like a product overload, where the product is sitting on the surface of your skin, making no impact and even clogging your pores,\" says Rodney. If you're still unsure, Rodney says to use two to three times a week.\n\nWorks well with: Gold nanoparticles are thought to potentially help other ingredients penetrate deeper into the skin, potentially enhancing the product. Ciraldo tells us that antioxidants and peptides should be very safe (and even beneficial) to use in conjunction with gold considering they are great ingredients to begin with. \"Antioxidants are so important--that is the main way to address, prevent, and even sometimes correct free radical damage,\" says Ciraldo. As for peptides, Ciraldo says, \"[Peptides] are an amazing family of ingredients that have so much diversity to them.\".\n\nDon't use with: Across the board, dermatologists recommend skipping gold if you're using retinol in the same routine. Rodney suggests alternating your retinol and gold usage at night to avoid potential irritation. Since AHAs have an exfoliative effect, you may not want to combine an AHA product in the same routine as your gold product. \"AHAs and retinol are in and of itself potentially irritating,\" says Ciraldo. \"I would not want to put gold into my skin with something we know [AHAs and retinol] is irritating.\"."
